## Overview
This repository contains a collection of some machine learning projects I have worked on. The projects are implemented in PyTorch. Each project is organized into its own directory with a `README.md` file that describes the project and provides instructions on how to run the code, as well as results and analysis conducted by me. This repo is a playground for me so projects may be disorganized
