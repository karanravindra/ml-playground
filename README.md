## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python. It serves as repo of projects and experiments that I have worked on. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and modular implementation of machine learning algorithms that can be easily integrated into PyTorch and Lighting projects.
